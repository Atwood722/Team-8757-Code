This is FRC team 8756 code, we are using yagsl with mk4i's, neos, navx2, and can sparkmaxes. 

Current issues:
	-No Turning, the robot will auto ajust its angle to feild orented forward, but we cant turn the robot using the controller
	-too fast, we cant find the speed ajustments so we just divided the controler inputs
	-slight jittering of the turning motors while driving, we think this is just a PID issue, just havent gotten around to it
